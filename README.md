# Real-Time Face Recognition using Dlib and OpenCV  

## Overview  
This project implements a real-time face recognition application using Dlib and OpenCV. It captures video from the webcam, compares captured faces with a provided reference image, and displays whether the detected face matches the reference.  

## Features  
- Real-time face detection and recognition.  
- Uses Dlib for facial landmark detection and face encoding.  
- Utilizes OpenCV for webcam access and image processing.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Required libraries:  
  - OpenCV  
  - Dlib  
  - NumPy  

You can install the required libraries using pip:  

```bash  
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy
